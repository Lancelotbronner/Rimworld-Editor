# Rimworld Editor

This is a very simple **prototype** to make basic content mods.

It makes use of Apple's 2023 beta APIs.

## Roadmap

Currently basic mods cannot be complete and require manual customization. Here's what needs to be added to support that:

- Texture handling and definition graphic data
- Sound handling and definition sound data

Some more features will be required to allow mods to use dependencies:

- Package dependencies
- Package relations

I'd like to improving integration with Apple's new beta features, as this project started to explore those APIs:

- Document initial configuration (creating the manifest and publishing schemes)
- Inspector
- Add the published mod as a writable content-type
